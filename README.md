## 📌 Project Overview

SmartAssist Vision is an AI-powered wearable mobility aid designed to assist visually impaired individuals through real-time object detection, obstacle awareness, distance estimation, and voice-guided navigation.

The system combines:

- MobileNet-SSD Object Detection
- Raspberry Pi 4 Model B
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- Voice Navigation using eSpeak / pyttsx3

This repository focuses on the **performance evaluation and analytics** of the prototype using a simulated evaluation dataset containing 5,000 detection records.

The project demonstrates how data analytics can be used to evaluate AI system performance through detection accuracy, confidence analysis, response time monitoring, safety metrics, and operational insights.
